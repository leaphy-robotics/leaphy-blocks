# Leaphy Blocks

Leaphy Blocks is an adaptation of the Blockly library. [Google's Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly) is a library that adds a visual code editor to web and mobile apps. The Blockly editor uses interlocking, graphical blocks to represent code concepts like variables, logical expressions, loops, and more. It allows users to apply programming principles without having to worry about syntax or the intimidation of a blinking cursor on the command line. All code is free and open source.

Leaphy Blocks is primarily developed for use in the [Leaphy Easybloqs](https://github.com/leaphy-robotics/leaphy-webbased) application. It is published as an npm package.

### Creating Custom Blocks

Good documentation about creating custom blocks exists in the [Google Blockly Developer Pages](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/overview).

### Fix a Bug

## Syncing with Google Blockly

Google Blocks typically releases a new version of Blockly once a quarter (every 3 months), or when a breaking bug needs an immediate fix. The Leaphy Blocks fork will be synced with those releases when they occur.

## Release Process

Use `yarn publish` and NOT `yarn run publish` to publish a new version of the npm package
